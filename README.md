# ReactiveForms in Angular

Reactive Forms in Angular provide a powerful and flexible way to manage form inputs and validations. This approach is particularly useful in Single Page Applications (SPA) to prevent page reloads when a form is submitted.

---

## üö´ Why Not Use Normal HTML Forms?
- Submitting a normal HTML form reloads the page by making an HTTP request to the server.
- In a Single Page Application (SPA) built with Angular, this behavior restarts the entire application, disrupting the user experience.
- Using Angular's **Reactive Forms** or **Template-Driven Forms** avoids this issue and simplifies form management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Create a Reactive Form

### Step 1: Import ReactiveFormsModule
Import the `ReactiveFormsModule` from `@angular/forms` to your Angular module.

```typescript
import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
```

---

### Step 2: Initialize a Form Group
Use the `FormGroup` class to initialize a form group.

---

### Step 3: Declare Form Controls
Declare the form controls in the `ngOnInit` lifecycle method and add them into the form group.

---

### Step 4: Bind Form Group to the HTML Form
Use property binding to bind the form group to the `<form>` tag in your HTML.

```html
<form [formGroup]="yourForm">
```

---

### Step 5: Assign Form Control Names
Provide a `formControlName` to each input field.

```html
<input formControlName="name" />
```

---

### Step 6: Add a Submit Button
Ensure the submit button in your form has the type `submit`.

```html
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
```

---

### Step 7: Add an Event Listener to the Form
Add the `(ngSubmit)` event to the form to handle form submission.

```html
<form (ngSubmit)="onFormSubmitted()">
```

---

## üõë Adding Validations to the Form
To add validations, use the `Validators` class from `@angular/forms`. For example:

```typescript
import { Validators } from '@angular/forms';
```

### Display Validation Messages
Use form control properties like `invalid`, `touched`, and `valid` to show validation messages or change styles dynamically.

```html
<input formControlName="email" />
<div *ngIf="email.invalid && email.touched" class="error">
  Please enter a valid email address.
</div>
```

## üìö FormArray: Managing Collections of Form Controls
The `FormArray` class allows you to manage a collection of form controls dynamically.

### Creating Form Controls
Angular provides two ways to group form controls:
1. **FormGroup**: Stores form controls as key-value pairs in an object.
2. **FormArray**: Stores form controls as elements in an array.

### Example: Adding Form Controls Dynamically
Use the `push` method, available exclusively for `FormArray`, to add controls dynamically.

```typescript
this.formArray.push(new FormControl(''));
```
